Retrospectives

What Is a Sprint Retrospective?

Sprint retrospectives usually happen after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning. They help a Scrum team review its process and identify opportunities to improve it.

As defined by The Scrum Guide,  the purpose of the sprint retrospective is to:

•	Inspect how the last sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;

•	Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements;

•	Create a plan to improve the way the Scrum team does its work.

Inputs:

•	Retro board

•	Setting the stage: by creating a comfortable and positive environment where everybody is willing to share their thoughts. 

•	Gathering data and Generating Insight:

•	Action items' tracking and results from the previous such meeting.

Out Puts

•	Motivated and empowered team that can identify what went well and how their contribution was acknowledged in making things great

•	Celebration of achievements

•	Concrete action items with assignee/owner identified, communicated and committed to resolve the challenges or issues.

Improve Productivity

Use root cause analysis to isolate problems and to avoid them, taking short terms steps for long-term improvements. For example, a team could have an issue with legacy code causing a large number of defects and rework during the testing of a particular sprint. As a result of the retrospective, the team can plan on adjusting, improving, or implementing different unit tests in order to eliminate this roadblock. Short-term investment would yield great improvements in the long run.

Skill Development

Retrospectives are the perfect opportunity to identify gaps in skills, address them, and to reduce single points of failure with a team or organization. Many teams have a resource with expertise in a specific domain. When that person is unavailable, we acknowledge the blocker but spin cycles trying to fix it on the spot or simply avoid the issue. Building on the example above, by identifying an individual with knowledge over legacy code, you can dedicate part of the next sprint for knowledge transfer, thereby building the skills of the team collectively.

Improve Morale

Retrospectives give a voice to the development teams, empowering them to share their experiences, as a collective, owning not only the content of the agenda but also the actions taken as a result of the meeting. The meeting serves as a purpose to voice frustrations (often leading to positive root cause analysis-based outcomes) and also to celebrate achievements and recognize the efforts of others, thereby bringing the team closer as a unit.

Improve Quality

By looking back through the sprint, development teams can examine and improve the quality of work. I have seen retrospectives be used to plan how user stories are structured as to avoid missing subtle requirements and doing rework. Retrospectives can also lead to formal changes to processes as well. After a bad commit, for example, a team may look at how they are conducting peer reviews or structuring unit or performance testing.

Increased Value

At the end of the day, the team is only as valuable as perceived by the client. By improving gradually over time, the client will reap the benefits in the form of improved feature sets delivered faster and of the highest quality. Retrospectives can help ensure that the client is engaged at the appropriate time to ensure their expectations are being met.

The Role of the Scrum Master During the Retrospective 
Within the Scrum Guide it says that the Scrum Master serves the other roles by  “Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed”. In particular about the Sprint Retrospective, it says that “The Scrum Master ensures that the meeting is positive and productive. The Scrum Master teaches all to keep it within the time-box. The Scrum Master participates as a peer team member in the meeting from the accountability over the Scrum process.”  It goes on to say  “The Scrum Master encourages the Scrum Team to improve, within the Scrum process framework, its development process and practices to make it more effective and enjoyable for the next Sprint.”
