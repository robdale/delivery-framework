## 1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery
Customers are happier when they receive working software at regular intervals, rather than waiting extended periods of time between releases.
* Be honest, but relentless. Change doesn’t happen overnight, it takes time. Stay focused and make the change a priority.
* Remove internal impediments that prevent the customers’ satisfaction from being the highest priority.
* Identify opportunities for delivering working solutions incrementally.
* Know thy customer. Engage with them regularly and define “value” together.
* Create feedback loops! Circle back with customers to ensure satisfaction and course correct when satisfaction has not been achieved. 

## 2. Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process
The ability to avoid delays when a requirement or feature request changes.
* Focus on short term goals without losing sight of the long-term vision.
* Planning is vital, but a plan can be worthless. Only plan for what’s in front of you. If the landscape changes, it will be easier and quicker, to pivot.
* Engage the customer frequently. It’s easier to know what changes should, or should not be implemented when there’s a common understanding of what the customer desires.
* Make sure stories are written such that they encompass all phases of software delivery.
* Ensure teams have all of the skill-sets needed to deliver end-to-end working software.
* Seek to understand the customer and the terrain in which the customer operates. This will help navigate changes to enable the customer’s competitive advantage.


## 3. Frequent delivery of working software
Scrum accommodates this principle since the team operates in software sprints or iterations that ensure regular delivery of working software.
* Move toward “vertical slice” user stories that can be completed and delivered end-to-end and independent of other user stories.
* Shorten sprints/iterations to 1-2 week timeboxes to limit focus, make smaller commitments and deliver completed work quicker.
* Write smaller user stories that can be completed within a day or no longer than two weeks.
* Look for incremental opportunities to improve the architecture and system to support more frequent releases.
* As much as possible, eliminate dependencies outside the team boundary that cause delays.

## 4. Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project
Better decisions are made when the business and technical team are aligned.
* Introduce/empower the scrum master role. Scrum masters are expert facilitators and collaborators. They can seamlessly liaise between all aspects of an organisation.
* Find opportunities for business people and developers observe each other working to help each side understand the challenges the other faces.
* When possible, co-locate all individuals involved with the work ensuring daily availability.
* Tear down the barriers! Move desks, tables, walls, etc. into a collaborative formation that brings everyone together in one easily accessible place.
* Be conscious and sensitive to time zone constraints and find a “golden window” of time when all individuals can come together for at least one hour a day.
* Be the change. Start by making collaboration a priority and finding time daily to be available so that a culture built on trust can begin to form.

## 5. Support, trust, and motivate the people involved
Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.
* More is not always more. Define a sustainable pace that teams can successfully maintain.
* Introduce/empower the product owner role. Ensure product owners are not only maintaining healthy backlogs, but providing the why behind the work so teams have purpose.
* Asks teams what type of working environment they need to be successful and then create it. It could be as simple as dimming the lights and keeping noise levels low (or high).
* Start building trust by eliminating micromanagement and instead holding teams accountable to what they believe they can accomplish.
* Introduce/empower the scrum master role. The scrum master can be one of the most supportive roles within a team. Scrum masters ensure teams have the support they need or escalate quickly when that is not the case. 

## 6. Communication is more successful when development teams are co-located.
The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
* Don't shy away from crucial conversations. Create a safe space to encourage teams and individuals to engage in face-to-face conversations even when the subject matter is difficult.
* Tear down the barriers! Move desks, tables, walls, etc. into a collaborative formation that brings everyone together in one easily accessible place. 
( Don't talk to tell, talk to listen. Remember to keep face-to-face conversations relevant and within a timebox to ensure high efficiency and effectiveness when people come together.
* Tools are good, but face-to-face conversations are great. Only use online collaboration technology/tools as needed and when you do, establish the best possible virtual presence. Turn those cameras on!
* When possible, co-locate all individuals involved with the work. For teams that cross time zones, create overlap in schedules and availability to allow for virtual face-to-face conversations. 

## 7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
Delivering functional software to the customer is the ultimate factor that measures progress.
* Go live! When possible, use live demos in an environment that could be accessible to the customer. 
* Perform a skill-set analysis and make sure the team has all the skills necessary to provide an end-to-end solution. If not, add someone who does or use this as a training opportunity.
* Eliminate dependencies where appropriate and ensure teams have identified or mitigated as much risk as possible.
* Focus on incremental progress by creating user stories that don't exceed the sprint/iteration timebox and leverage the INVEST user story format.
* Metrics help with decision making, but working solutions that solve customers' problems should be the primary measure of progress. 

## 8. Agile processes to support a consistent delivery pace
Teams establish a repeatable and maintainable speed at which they can deliver working software, and they repeat it with each release.
* Define a continuous planning lifecycle that balances work weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc. Avoid low and high tides of work to create a steady flow. 
* Empower teams to set their own pace and allow them to adjust it when appropriate.
* More functionality may not actually deliver more value to the customer. Be thoughtful about what functionality needs to be completed, and be sure to follow up and verify that the solutions being created are actually providing value.
*  Find the path of least resistance. Start with or scale back to simple, lean processes and approvals. Only incorporate additional workflows when the desired outcome is not being achieved.
* Advocate for a pace that promotes continuous delivery. Allow for flexibility within scope or time and focus on a sustainable pace of value being delivered to the customer. 

## 9. Focus on technical excellence and good design  
 Empower the team to be innovative whilst also aiming to achieve a standard of excellence of technical and design excellence.  They will be better placed to accommodate unforeseen changes.
* Change will always be difficult, but the cost of not trying new things or fixing what's broken risks the organisation’s relevancy. Find incremental opportunities for change.
* Explore possibilities of what could be! Encourage product owners and managers to evolve skill-sets to include design thinking.
* Create with a purpose, but don't stifle innovation. Understand what needs to be created, but then allow flexibility in how it will be created.
* Establish a "definition of done" – the standard of excellence that all user stories will abide by and adhere to ensuring as little compromise to technical excellence as possible.
* Invest in training opportunities to further grow the skill-sets of teams through conferences, workshops, webinars, online/in person courses and cross-team collaboration.

## 10. Keep Product delivery simple
Start with an MVP and iterate quickly whilst ensuring value is provided with each iteration.
* Watch. Listen. Stay close. Engage the customer frequently (before, during, and after release) to ensure solutions delight the customer. Not every idea or solution is what they need.
* Shift from project-based funding models to capacity-based funding models that support minimal viable solutions and avoid set plans that will inevitably change.
* Eliminate the waste and find the paths of least resistance. Consider "lean thinking", simplify workflows and avoid unnecessary steps in processes.
* In accordance with agile principles #1 and #3, it's critical to focus on the minimal viable solution to deliver frequently and incrementally to the customer. Focus on delighting the customer with the least amount of time and cost.
* Name the problem. Scale back to the minimal solution needed to solve the problem. Only enhance the solution when the customer requires it. Follow the lean start-up ideas of measure, build, learn.

## 11. Self-organizing teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs
Skilled and motivated team members who have decision-making power, take ownership, communicate regularly with other team members, and share ideas that deliver quality products.
* Give the power to the people! Hold teams accountable to what they say they can and cannot do and then empower them to be successful. Lead instead of direct.Teams will have valuable insight into solutions they have, or currently are, creating. Include them in conversations early and often.
* De-centralise decision making by empowering teams to make all necessary decisions quickly and iteratively to avoid delays in delighting the customer.
* Focus on up-playing the strengths of team members and ensure each team collectively has the skill-sets needed to accomplish the work. Value delivered > organisational structure.
* In adherence with agile principles #1, #2, #3, and #10, it's important to move away from pre-defined project plans. Iterating on the work requires frequent participation from teams and inevitably will result in better solutions. 
## 12. Regular reflections on how to become more effective
Self-improvement, process improvement, advancing skills, and techniques help team members work more efficiently.
* Introduce retrospectives! Build in a minimum of two hours between projects (or even better, between iterations/sprints) for teams to come together and reflect.
* Set ground rules for retrospectives, and stand by them! Identify working agreements that create safety and trust  encouraging candid communication within the team boundary.
* Task your scrum master with keeping retrospectives interesting, engaging, and productive.
* Embrace and celebrate failures as learning opportunities. Some of the greatest innovations and most iconic people in history were born out of failure.
* Capture action items that come out of retrospectives and track the progress and completion of them. Teams will quickly see which things are being addressed (and which aren't).
