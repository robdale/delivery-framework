# Principles
## 1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery
Customers are happier when they receive working software at regular intervals, rather than waiting extended periods of time between releases.
* Be honest, but relentless. Change doesn’t happen overnight, it takes time. Stay focused and make the change a priority.
* Remove internal impediments that prevent the customers’ satisfaction from being the highest priority.
* Identify opportunities for delivering working solutions incrementally.
* Know thy customer. Engage with them regularly and define “value” together.
* Create feedback loops! Circle back with customers to ensure satisfaction and course correct when satisfaction has not been achieved. 

## 2. Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process
The ability to avoid delays when a requirement or feature request changes.
* Focus on short term goals without losing sight of the long-term vision.
* Planning is vital, but a plan can be worthless. Only plan for what’s in front of you. If the landscape changes, it will be easier and quicker, to pivot.
* Engage the customer frequently. It’s easier to know what changes should, or should not be implemented when there’s a common understanding of what the customer desires.
* Make sure stories are written such that they encompass all phases of software delivery.
* Ensure teams have all of the skill-sets needed to deliver end-to-end working software.
* Seek to understand the customer and the terrain in which the customer operates. This will help navigate changes to enable the customer’s competitive advantage.


## 3. Frequent delivery of working software
Scrum accommodates this principle since the team operates in software sprints or iterations that ensure regular delivery of working software.
* Move toward “vertical slice” user stories that can be completed and delivered end-to-end and independent of other user stories.
* Shorten sprints/iterations to 1-2 week timeboxes to limit focus, make smaller commitments and deliver completed work quicker.
* Write smaller user stories that can be completed within a day or no longer than two weeks.
* Look for incremental opportunities to improve the architecture and system to support more frequent releases.
* As much as possible, eliminate dependencies outside the team boundary that cause delays.

## 4. Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project
Better decisions are made when the business and technical team are aligned.
* Introduce/empower the scrum master role. Scrum masters are expert facilitators and collaborators. They can seamlessly liaise between all aspects of an organisation.
* Find opportunities for business people and developers observe each other working to help each side understand the challenges the other faces.
* When possible, co-locate all individuals involved with the work ensuring daily availability.
* Tear down the barriers! Move desks, tables, walls, etc. into a collaborative formation that brings everyone together in one easily accessible place.
* Be conscious and sensitive to time zone constraints and find a “golden window” of time when all individuals can come together for at least one hour a day.
* Be the change. Start by making collaboration a priority and finding time daily to be available so that a culture built on trust can begin to form.

## 5. Support, trust, and motivate the people involved – Motivated teams are more likely to deliver their best work than unhappy teams.
Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.
* More is not always more. Define a sustainable pace that teams can successfully maintain.
* Introduce/empower the product owner role. Ensure product owners are not only maintaining healthy backlogs, but providing the why behind the work so teams have purpose.
* Asks teams what type of working environment they need to be successful and then create it. It could be as simple as dimming the lights and keeping noise levels low (or high).
* Start building trust by eliminating micromanagement and instead holding teams accountable to what they believe they can accomplish.
* Introduce/empower the scrum master role. The scrum master can be one of the most supportive roles within a team. Scrum masters ensure teams have the support they need or escalate quickly when that is not the case. 

## 6. Enable face-to-face interactions – Communication is more successful when development teams are co-located.
The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
* Don't shy away from crucial conversations. Create a safe space to encourage teams and individuals to engage in face-to-face conversations even when the subject matter is difficult.
* Tear down the barriers! Move desks, tables, walls, etc. into a collaborative formation that brings everyone together in one easily accessible place. 
( Don't talk to tell, talk to listen. Remember to keep face-to-face conversations relevant and within a timebox to ensure high efficiency and effectiveness when people come together.
* Tools are good, but face-to-face conversations are great. Only use online collaboration technology/tools as needed and when you do, establish the best possible virtual presence. Turn those cameras on!
* When possible, co-locate all individuals involved with the work. For teams that cross time zones, create overlap in schedules and availability to allow for virtual face-to-face conversations. 

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress – Delivering functional software to the customer is the ultimate factor that measures progress.
8. Agile processes to support a consistent development pace – Teams establish a repeatable and maintainable speed at which they can deliver working software, and they repeat it with each release.
9. Attention to technical detail and design enhances agility – The right skills and good design ensures the team can maintain the pace, constantly improve the product, and sustain change.
10. Simplicity – Develop just enough to get the job done for right now.
## 11. Self-organizing teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs
Skilled and motivated team members who have decision-making power, take ownership, communicate regularly with other team members, and share ideas that deliver quality products.
* Give the power to the people! Hold teams accountable to what they say they can and cannot do and then empower them to be successful. Lead instead of direct.Teams will have valuable insight into solutions they have, or currently are, creating. Include them in conversations early and often.
* De-centralise decision making by empowering teams to make all necessary decisions quickly and iteratively to avoid delays in delighting the customer.
* Focus on up-playing the strengths of team members and ensure each team collectively has the skill-sets needed to accomplish the work. Value delivered > organisational structure.
* In adherence with agile principles #1, #2, #3, and #10, it's important to move away from pre-defined project plans. Iterating on the work requires frequent participation from teams and inevitably will result in better solutions. 
## 12. Regular reflections on how to become more effective
Self-improvement, process improvement, advancing skills, and techniques help team members work more efficiently.
* Introduce retrospectives! Build in a minimum of two hours between projects (or even better, between iterations/sprints) for teams to come together and reflect.
* Set ground rules for retrospectives, and stand by them! Identify working agreements that create safety and trust  encouraging candid communication within the team boundary.
* Task your scrum master with keeping retrospectives interesting, engaging, and productive.
* Embrace and celebrate failures as learning opportunities. Some of the greatest innovations and most iconic people in history were born out of failure.
* Capture action items that come out of retrospectives and track the progress and completion of them. Teams will quickly see which things are being addressed (and which aren't).
